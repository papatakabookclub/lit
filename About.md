"Hello and welcome to Soumith's Shelf! My name is Soumith, and I'm an Electrical Engineer with a passion for learning and exploring new technologies. When I'm not working on engineering projects, you can find me buried in a good book. I'm also the founder of the [Papataka Book Club](https://www.instagram.com/papatakabookclub/), where I love to engage in thoughtful discussions with fellow book enthusiasts.

As an engineer and a lifelong learner, I'm constantly curious about the world around me and always looking to expand my knowledge. I love exploring different technologies and discovering new ways to apply them to solve problems.

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries with my readers. I hope to inspire and educate others who share my love for learning, exploring, and making meaningful connections. Thank you for stopping by, and I can't wait to connect with you!"
